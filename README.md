# OpenPass
Open source and secure iOS Password Manager

## Trustworthy
OpenPass is 100% open source, so you can be absolutely sure that your passwords are in fact being stored securely on the device, and not saved in some database for people to steal them.

## Secure
Saved passwords are encrypted, using AES-GCM, whose keys are encrypted by RSA, and the RSA key is securely stored on Apple's Keychain

## Useful
OpenPass is convenient, intuitive, and easy to use.
There is also an iMessage extension allowing you to send your passwords to someone if need be. When sending, the password is encrypted the whole way through, so it is sent securely.
